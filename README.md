# lib--cathode-simulations
plotscripts and data analysis for simulations of lib-cathodes

Selection of plotscripts and tools that I am using on a day to day basis. Most of the scripts are tailored towards my needs but can easily be altered. Main goal is to present the data derived from microstructural analysis and comsol calculations of virtual NMC- cathodes.
